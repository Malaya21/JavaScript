# Basic JavaScript Interview Questions

---

## Question 1: What is JavaScript?
**Answer:** JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is a client-side language that runs in the browser, but it can also be used on the server-side with environments like Node.js.

## Question 2: What are the different data types in JavaScript?
**Answer:** JavaScript has several data types, including:
- **Number:** Represents numeric values.
- **String:** Represents textual data.
- **Boolean:** Represents true or false values.
- **Object:** Represents complex data structures.
- **Array:** Represents ordered collections of values.
- **Null:** Represents the absence of a value.
- **Undefined:** Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.
- **Symbol:** Represents unique identifiers.

## Question 3: What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
**Answer:** The `==` operator checks for equality after performing type coercion, while the `===` operator checks for equality without type coercion. This means that the `===` operator will only return true if both the value and the type of the operands are the same, while the `==` operator may return true even if the types are different.

## Question 4: What is a closure in JavaScript?
**Answer:** A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. This allows the function to access variables and parameters from the outer function even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are commonly used to create private variables and functions in JavaScript.

## Question 5: What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript?
**Answer:** `let` and `const` are block-scoped variables introduced in ES6, while `var` is function-scoped. Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned, but not redeclared in the same scope, while variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned or redeclared. `var` does not have these restrictions and can be hoisted to the top of its scope.

## Question 6: What is the event loop in JavaScript?
**Answer:** The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows for non-blocking asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack for functions to execute and the callback queue for events to process. When the call stack is empty, the event loop moves events from the callback queue to the call stack, allowing them to be executed.

## Question 7: What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
**Answer:** `null` represents the intentional absence of any value, while `undefined` represents the absence of a value that has not been assigned. The `typeof null` returns `object`, while `undefined` is a type. `null` is often used to represent an empty value, while `undefined` is typically the value of an uninitialized variable.

## Question 8: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
**Answer:** Synchronous programming executes code sequentially and blocks further execution until the current operation is completed, while asynchronous programming allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently. Asynchronous operations use callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle the completion of tasks without blocking the main thread.

## Question 9: What is the DOM in JavaScript?
**Answer:** The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes, with each node representing an element, attribute, or text in the document. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically update the content, structure, and style of a web page.
